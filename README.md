I decided to set a "PSX" mode for low quality graphics and  
I really liked it, if you want good graphics, set the constant  
variable PSX to false  

### Controls

 - `W, A, S, D, Scroll` - Move
 - `Q, E` - Move down and up
 - `0, 1, 2, ..., 8` - Sun to Neptune
 - `R` - Reset your camera direction
 - `F` - Enable/Disable going faster
 - `ARROWS` - Move camera 90 degrees
 
 ### Todo
 
- Fix rotation movement to make poles stay being poles
- Add planets names
- Make planets cast shadows
- Make the camera be able to control from a mobile device
